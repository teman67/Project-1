# Tiny World for Your Tinies

The aim of our webpage is to make the fascinating world of nanotechnology accessible and engaging for kids. We believe that learning about nanotechnology should be fun and educational, which is why our webpage is designed to provide young learners with a playful and interactive introduction to this groundbreaking field.

Through colorful visuals, easy-to-understand explanations, and hands-on activities, we aim to demystify the concept of nanotechnology. Our goal is to spark curiosity and inspire the next generation of scientists and innovators by showing them how tiny particles, at the nanoscale, can have a big impact on our everyday lives.

### Features Left to Implement

- Introducing another page where users can access real videos and images of the course would be highly advantageous.

## Testing 

- I have checked the website on different screen sizes and it works well.
- To increase the performance of the website, I changed the images from .jpg or .png to .webp when the size of the images were too large.
- On the Home page, the position of the images is dependent on which cellphone size is used. I could not fix this issue.
- The webpage works well when I used Google chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge web browsers.

### Unfixed Bugs

When I use media query for cellphone size, in the home page, the first green bullet point goes to the right side of the screen in google chrome while in firefox it is in a correct side. I have checked different parameters in my css styling but I could not solve it. I also searched on google and stack overflow and still the isuue was not solved.
